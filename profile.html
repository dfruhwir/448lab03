		Before his rise to fame in the legendary videogame Grand Theft Auto V, Trevor Phillips was an "ordinary" man. He was born in good ole Canada. As a child, he had a slight temper leading to fairly frequent run-ins with the law. Sick of being around kind citizens, he moved to the great city of Los Santos.

Trevor likes to hang out with his partners Michael, Franklin, Cletus
